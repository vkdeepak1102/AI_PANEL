Exposure to scalability, caching, and backend architecture principles",Selected,"Interviewer: Good morning, Arun. Welcome to the interview for the Backend Engineer role. How are you today?

Arun Kumar: Good morning. I’m doing well, thank you. I appreciate the opportunity.

Interviewer: Before we begin, I’d like to give you a brief overview of today’s interview. We’ll be discussing your background, Python fundamentals, and some backend-related concepts. Let’s start with your background. Can you tell me about your experience as a backend engineer?

Arun Kumar: Sure. I have around three years of experience working mainly with Python. In my current role, I work on backend APIs and basic database operations. I mostly handle feature development and bug fixes.

Interviewer: That sounds good. Let’s talk about Python fundamentals. Can you explain the different data types available in Python?

Arun Kumar: Python has data types like integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

Interviewer: Can you explain the difference between a list and a tuple?

Arun Kumar: A list is mutable, so we can change it, and a tuple is immutable, so we cannot change it.

Interviewer: Good. Now let’s move into data structures. Can you explain what a stack is and where it is used?

Arun Kumar: A stack follows the LIFO principle. I understand the concept, but I haven’t really used it much in real applications.

Interviewer: Okay. How would you implement a stack in Python?

Arun Kumar: I think we can use a list, but I’m not sure about the exact implementation details.

Interviewer: That’s fine. Can you explain the difference between a stack and a queue?

Arun Kumar: A stack is LIFO, and a queue is FIFO.

Interviewer: Have you worked with more advanced data structures like trees or graphs?

Arun Kumar: I have studied them theoretically, but I haven’t implemented them in my projects.

Interviewer: Understood. Let’s talk briefly about performance. How do you analyze the time complexity of a Python program?

Arun Kumar: I know about Big O notation, but I usually don’t calculate it unless required.

Interviewer: Thank you for your honesty. Do you have any experience optimizing code for performance?

Arun Kumar: Not really. I mostly write simple logic that works correctly.

Interviewer: Alright. That’s all the questions from my side. Do you have any questions for us?

Arun Kumar: No, I think that’s fine. Thank you for your time.

Priya S: WHERE is used to filter rows, and HAVING is used after GROUP BY to filter aggregated results.

Interviewer: Good. Can you write a SQL query to find duplicate records in a table?

Priya S: I think we can use GROUP BY with COUNT, but I’m not fully confident about the exact query syntax.

Interviewer: That’s okay. Can you explain how INNER JOIN works?

Priya S: INNER JOIN combines records from two tables when there is a matching value in both tables.

Interviewer: Let’s go a bit deeper. Suppose you have sales and customer tables. How would you find customers who have not made any purchases?

Priya S: I think we can use a LEFT JOIN, but I’m not very sure how to write that query correctly.

Interviewer: Alright. Now let’s move on to communication. How do you usually present your analysis to business stakeholders?

Priya S: I usually explain the numbers using charts, but sometimes I feel nervous and find it difficult to answer follow-up questions clearly.

Interviewer: Can you give an example of a time when you had to explain a complex insight to a non-technical audience?

Priya S: I try to simplify it, but honestly, I still struggle with presenting confidently.
